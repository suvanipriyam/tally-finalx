                        <p className="p-3">
                          A set of account books represents a 'company' in
                          Tally.ERP 9. Therefore, if you decide to maintain your
                          personal accounts you would create a 'company'. Many
                          businesses do have more than one legal entity - and so
                          will require multi-company support. Since each company
                          is a distinct 'data base', building technical support
                          for this is not difficult.
                        </p>

                        <p className="p-3">
                          However, with multiple companies, several needs often
                          arise beyond the mere facility to record transactions
                          that need to be addressed,.
                        </p>

                        <p className="p-3">
                          Principally, you would like to look at consolidated
                          reports since these are often more meaningful to you
                          than statutory reports of each company individually.
                          You can therefore 'group' companies and have the
                          reporting ability as if this were a 'company'. You
                          could also 'group' these on demand or as required. So
                          Partner A, could group companies in which he is a
                          partner (say Companies P, Q &amp; R) and Partner B
                          could have a group with Companies Q, R &amp; Y.
                        </p>

                        <p className="p-3">
                          With multiple companies, you would probably need to
                          compare them to see relative figures. In Tally.ERP 9,
                          while seeing a report for Company P, you could pull up
                          another column alongside that shows figures from
                          Company Q (and any more companies). You can now
                          continue to drill down the report and continue to see
                          these comparisons.
                        </p>

                        <p className="p-3">
                          Quiet often with multiple companies, the need arises
                          to create the same ledgers &amp; post transactions to
                          more than one company. This can be accomplished with
                          the click of a few keys - you save immense time by not
                          having to re-enter data and avoid data entry errors.
                        </p>

                        <p className="p-3">
                          In special circumstances, where there are needs like a
                          Purchase Order entry becoming a Sales Order in another
                          company, our Service Partners will be able to work
                          with you, understand specific requirements and build a

                        <p className="p-3">
                          Security: With multiple companies, possibly including
                          personal accounts, you may need to control who gets
                          access to which companies, and to do what. You can set
                          up users, grant or deny access - and these are defined
                          for each company.

                          accessible remotely. You choose which remote users
                          have access; you decide what access a remote user
                          gets.

                          Central User Management: Users come and go. You might
                          also have a password policy requiring users to change
                          passwords every few weeks. You can take advantage of
                          the ease of central user and password management that
                          Tally.NET identities carry - and even remotely manage
                          these while not in office.
