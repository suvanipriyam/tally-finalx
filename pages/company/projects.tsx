                      <p>
                        The origin of Maharishi Ayurveda dates back to 1980,
                        when Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of
                        Transcendental Meditation began working with
                        India&apos;s top three Ayurvedic experts - Dr. V.M.
                        Dwivedi, Dr. B.D. Triguna and Dr. Balaraj Maharishi.
                        Maharishi formed a medical council to create authentic
                      </p>

                    <p>
                      herbal formulations according to Ayurvedic texts and also
                      established an international network of doctors, clinics
                      and schools dedicated to eliminating disease and offering
                      perfect health to people worldwide. MAPPL in its entirety,
                      as it is today was conceived later under the
                      Maharishi&apos;s Global Plan and was intended to cater to
                      the rapidly growing demands, also in the Indian Market.

                    <p>
                      It is also manufacturing a range of patented products like
                      Kasni, Amlant, Raktda, Restone, Livomap, Pirant, Herbonic
                      etc. and Classical Products like Asavas, Arishtas, Bhasms
                      and others. Today MAPPL products, covering more than 900
                      formulations, are not only distributed all over India,
                      through an extensive network of Distributors, but also

                    <p>
                      MAPPL realizes the need of quality management, as Ayurveda
                      was in a prolonged period of hibernation during foreign
                      regimes and during this period of hibernation the health
                      needs of the society changed greatly. Therefore it is
                      imperative to review the concepts of Ayurveda in the light
                      of the changes in health care needs and of modern
                      technology so as to make it applicable to the changed
                      socioeconomic scenario.
